            <h2>Locating leftWING's Private and Public Folders</h2>
            <p>
                The correct placement of leftWING's files is of
                sound importance for its reliable deployment. So let
                us follow a sample installation that user <strong>igor</strong>
                has choosen on his machine that hosts a webserver. It's not unlikely
                that on this machine we have the following two folders:
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                <span>Igor's home folder:</span>/home/igor/<br />
                <span>webserver document root:</span>/var/www/htdocs/
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that the webserver can &ndash; under no cirumstances &ndash;
                access igor's home folder. Even if it fails for some reason the webserver wouldn't be able to serve
                e.g. uninterpreted <strong>.php</strong> files containing passwords and
                other secrets that are stored in this location. So this location is a very good one to
                place the first folder <strong>leftwing/</strong> that
                comes with leftwing.zip since it is exactly this folder that contains those
                files of leftWING that never should be served directly by a webserver.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are, however, files that must be served by the webserver
                to let leftWING do its job. These files are located in
                the second folder <strong>lw/</strong> that comes within leftWING.zip.
                And so it is crucial to place this one somewhere <strong>within</strong> the
                webserver's document root. Igor made the following decisions:
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                <span>leftWING's private files</span>/home/igor/leftwing/<br />
                <span>leftWING's public files: </span>/var/www/htdocs/lw/
            </p>
            <p>
                After we have placed (or better: distributed) our files in a reliable way on igor's
                machine we must assure that both of leftWING's two parts, the private as well as
                the public one, get knowledge of each other in some way.
            </p>
            <h2>Connecting leftWING's Private and Public Folders</h2>
            <p>
                In order to let the public parts of leftWING applications know, where
                they can find leftWING's private parts, it is a good (but not the only) idea to
                locate a file named <strong>leftwing.php</strong> one folder above the
                webserver's document root. This file may not contain anything else
                but a single <strong>require_once</strong> including leftWING's
                initial class file <strong>system.php</strong> that lives in leftWING's
                private root folder:
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                <span>File:</span>/var/www/leftwing.php<br />
                <span>Content:</span>&lt;?php require_once "/home/igor/leftwing/system.php"; ?&gt;
            </p>
            <pre>
&lt;?php
namespace leftWING;
require_once __DIR__ . "/lib/environment.php";
function leftWING(
    $absoluteWebRoot,
    $customer,
    $applicationShortcut,
    $development){
    
    return environment::instantiate(
        
        // System Web Root
        // The relative path to $_SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"]
        // Start and terminate with a '/'
        // ..............................................
        "/lw/",
        
        // mysql Server Connection Data
        // ----------------------------
        "localhost",    // host
        "igor",      // username
        "igorspassword",     // password
        "leftwing",     // system database name

        $absoluteWebRoot, $customer, $applicationShortcut, $development
    );
}
function run(
    $absoluteWebRoot,
    $customer,
    $applicationShortcut,
    $development = false){
    leftWING(
        $absoluteWebRoot,
        $customer,
        $applicationShortcut,
        $development)->handleRequest();
}
function javascript(
    $absoluteWebRoot,
    $customer,
    $applicationShortcut,
    $development = false){
    leftWING(
        $absoluteWebRoot,
        $customer,
        $applicationShortcut,
        $development)->javascript();
}
?&lt;                
            </pre>
            <h2>leftWING Javascript</h2>
            <p>
                Essentially leftWINGjs is an object hierarchy providing functionality that is typical
                for some type of web application.

            <h3>Buttons</h3>
            <p>
                Buttons are merely <strong>triggers</strong> for click events. They do <strong>not listen</strong>
                to click events and so they cannot react to click events on their own. We made this decision in
                anticipation of button intensive applications that often want to listen to button clicks in one
                location in order to handle those clicks within one part of code. The underlying problem that is
                solved by button objects is the transformation of a keyboard events into a proper  mouse event.
                This is a good idea since keyboard events don't ship with position information. This normally
                can lead to e.g. lousy dialog popups in reaction of a button that has been pushed by pressing a
                key on the keyboard. Button
